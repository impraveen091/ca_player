export const about_us = 'A mobile application or app is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch. Mobile applications often stand in contrast to desktop applications which are designed to run on desktop computers,which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on the mobile device.Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and contact bases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as mobile games, factory ation, GPS and location-based services, order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now millions of apps available. Many apps require Internet access. Apps are generally downloaded from app stores, which are a type of digital distribution platforms.'
